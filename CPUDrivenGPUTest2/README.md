# CPUDrivenGPUTest2

This project is about extending the previous CPUDrivenGPUTest1 project forwards and including new hardware and functionality. It's also about replacing the CPU-provided SWTnL vertex processing pipeline with a HWTnL vertex shader core, and all that that entails (which takes a major re-architecting!)
