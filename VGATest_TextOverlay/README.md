This is the most advanced framebufferless project to date. It involves reading a dithered tiling background image and then drawing alpha-tested 2-color sprites from a spritemap on top of it. These sprites are font sprites (although they could just as easily be game sprites since their positions, types, and colors can change dynamically) for drawing debug overlay text.
