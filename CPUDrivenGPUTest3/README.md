# CPUDrivenGPUTest3

This project is about extending the previous CPUDrivenGPUTest2 project forwards and including new hardware and functionality. It's also about replacing the old 1Mbit serial communications core with a much faster new 1Gbit Ethernet communications core which runs using a custom reliable UDP protocol (uses UDP over IPv4).
